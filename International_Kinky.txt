This is the Lund one. It's more cylindrical.

In Sweden what you do is being awkward around each other for about two months and then you "happen" to be at the same party and then you get really drunk...

678553998@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 8:13pm PST
But you can go during the night and sleep on the bus

678553998@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 8:11pm PST
It is a looot cheaper than train or flight usually, but takes like 7 hours tho

678553998@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 8:11pm PST
Cheapest way by far to get to oslo is with bus!! Netbus or swebus are both good companies

100000358561047@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 7:52pm PST
If you have a flexible schedule and are not a big fan of being stuck in the train for a long time, what about having a stopover at G√∂teborg? The price is not gonna be that different I guess

100001881855769@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 7:42pm PST
Last time I checked the trains for Oslo, it was about 9 hours with 3 changes. For ~30 more euros, you can get a flight there (if you book early enough I guess)

1829562775@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 11:46am PST
They might not look super close at the date? Also perhaps NZ has a longer travel visa in EU than the US does. Just make sure to keep it in mind

100000651408117@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 11:44am PST
Eeek that worries me, mine runs out a few days before I leave (I forgot to check it when booking my flights) :/

Ikr? I happened to have my card in my wallet still and guy seemed a bit annoyed and told me that I should show it whenever I show my passport

100000651408117@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 11:39am PST
That's weird

1829562775@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 11:39am PST
Because when you go to the border control people, to get to your gate, they look at the stamps. And most travel visas cap at 3 months.

100000651408117@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 11:38am PST
What? Why?

1829562775@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 11:26am PST
Like even if you're flying home

In the airport

1829562775@facebook.comSaturday, December 17, 2016 at 11:26am PST
Just a heads up in case you weren't already aware: they will not let you through border control without your residence permit

1120252296@facebook.comSunday, December 11, 2016 at 5:42pm PST
I was there just yesterday around this time Without booking an appointment. Too about 30mins to see a nurse, which isnt considered a long time

100000489294947@facebook.comSunday, December 11, 2016 at 5:34pm PST
emergency doctor may not be the perfect translation, sorry :D But you can always consult a doctor at the hospital as far as I know

1829562775@facebook.comSunday, December 11, 2016 at 5:34pm PST
So is there a cheap easy thing I can do at the normal hospital? Or think I could wait to go to the student one tomorrow when they are open?

100002013437311@facebook.comSunday, December 11, 2016 at 5:32pm PST
They have both at the hospital

1829562775@facebook.comSunday, December 11, 2016 at 5:31pm PST

You can also call 1177 for free medical advice of what to do

100000489294947@facebook.comSunday, December 11, 2016 at 5:28pm PST
The university hospital, though I dont know any details

563324117@facebook.comSunday, December 11, 2016 at 5:27pm PST
Which hospital? I might need to get antibiotics

100000489294947@facebook.comSunday, December 11, 2016 at 5:26pm PST
I remember they told as in the beginning of the semester, that you can go to the hospital to get checked super cheap, because you get checked by medicin students or something like that. For a simple infection I guess that is fine. It's 60 Kr if I remember that correctly

1829562775@facebook.comSunday, December 11, 2016 at 5:23pm PST
Yo how do I see a doctor before I leave? I got a cut on my hand/finger that looks like it is infected. It's generally not a good idea to wait too long so I was hoping I could get something before I leave.

1829562775@facebook.comThursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:36pm PST
Yeah but an actual pumpkin would also work. I can't go to all the stores because we need to cook so if one of you could try places I haven't

100000489294947@facebook.comThursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:36pm PST
I just remember someone told me he couldn't find such a filling, so I guess chances are bad

1829562775@facebook.comThursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:35pm PST
If you can find canned pumpkin then yes, otherwise an actual pumpkin will do

100000489294947@facebook.comThursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:34pm PST
Do you mean this premade pumpkin pie filling?

1829562775@facebook.comThursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:34pm PST
Any swedes know where we could get that stuff?

1829562775@facebook.comThursday, November 24, 2016 at 4:34pm PST
So can anyone get pumpkin and pie crust? I've tried ica Willys and coop with no luck

With that said, me and olafur are unavailable the 10th

1574456032@facebook.comWednesday, November 23, 2016 at 4:02pm PST
In my experience with this group it's better to not try to come to a consensus on dates/times/places but rather to just be authoritarian and slap a date on and tell people to come.

100002430109330@facebook.comThursday, November 17, 2016 at 11:10am PST
Isn't that what people usually write in diaries?

1829562775@facebook.comThursday, November 17, 2016 at 11:08am PST
True most were edited out. I just meant the original diary contained such mentions

100000489294947@facebook.comThursday, November 17, 2016 at 10:02am PST
Actually the originally published version, by her dad, did not contain sexual and too intimate topics. But since the book was such a huge success and people saw more in it the book than only a story about a girl, he eventually decided to add those topics again, that he first left out

1829562775@facebook.comThursday, November 17, 2016 at 9:51am PST

yep, just need to update my skills in C++ as it's been a long time since I coded in it

1829562775@facebook.comTuesday, November 8, 2016 at 1:00pm PST
Would you be fine using C++?

1566321624@facebook.comTuesday, November 8, 2016 at 12:48pm PST
I still don't have a partner for the project. If you need one, just let me know ;)

100000651408117@facebook.comTuesday, November 8, 2016 at 12:46pm PST
Okies :)

1829562775@facebook.comTuesday, November 8, 2016 at 12:46pm PST
I'll ask around but if you happen to recall someone doesnt; lmk

1829562775@facebook.comTuesday, November 8, 2016 at 12:46pm PST
Well if I miss a 1/6th of the course and already need to catch up there is no way I'm going to tackle a project solo haha

100000651408117@facebook.comTuesday, November 8, 2016 at 12:44pm PST
Not sure, I think most of us would've found partners by now, but you can ask around, plus having a partner isn't mandatory

1829562775@facebook.comTuesday, November 8, 2016 at 12:43pm PST
That's what I'm doing now, I'll be at lecture today. Think I could find a decent project partner if I did add the course?

100000651408117@facebook.comTuesday, November 8, 2016 at 12:41pm PST
Ah, well it's only been a week and all we've done is go over what we should know for the course, so we did basic stuff like gcd and modular arithmetic and then into things like finite fields made out of polynomials... So maybe go onto the course page and look at the lecture notes and/or exercise questions and see what you think?

1829562775@facebook.comTuesday, November 8, 2016 at 12:39pm PST
I have done discrete math but 3 years ago

100000651408117@facebook.comTuesday, November 8, 2016 at 12:39pm PST
Have you done discrete math or cryptography before?

1829562775@facebook.comTuesday, November 8, 2016 at 12:39pm PST
I'm considering late adding it but I feel like I have missed too much of the material. Looks daunting....

I think all cables in the computer labs are tied together so you would have to crawl under the table and stuff. What I would do is talk to Mattias Eklund who usually is around iD√©t (big bearded guy). Tell him I sent you and you can lend some of our equipment otherwise try to find me in iD√©t and do the same

Hey, @mentors: I wanna try something with a raspberry Pi, I got the Pi but I would need a mouse&Keyboard and a screen to connect with HDMI Is there a student room to do this? Or maybe a pc room with hdmi connected monitors, then I could just use the stuff and plug it back in afterwards üôàüôà

He didn't specify whether he was talking about distances or Trump, tho!

807722489@facebook.comTuesday, October 25, 2016 at 3:27pm PDT
Farther away would be the correct use with regards to physical distances IIRC. I think further applies to abstract distances, e.g. "I'm further away from Trump, politically, than I am from Bernie Sanders". Could be the other way around though. :/

807722489@facebook.comMonday, October 17, 2016 at 3:25pm PDT
Also, the uni has found that people study better in groups, discussing the subject, so they focus a lot on study and fika areas where you can both be social and study. So they kind of encourage people to study in group rooms, but there aren't enough of them, which is why there is a problem here; we've developed a culture of studying in school.

If you find that type of humor funny then you should try watching the nz film "boy", it's very kiwi stereotypical

100000651408117@facebook.comThursday, October 6, 2016 at 10:48am PDT

@Gemma I saw this comment today I response to a NZ anti drinking ad: "This ad is deeply embedded in the kiwi lexicon now. In the last week I've definitely made a ghost-chups joke, and also regularly use "Monique sez you're dumb" and "puzzle time"." here is the ad: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CtWirGxV7Q8&feature=youtu.be Can you verify this? Lol cause I really wanna start saying it

1829562775@facebook.comFriday, September 30, 2016 at 12:40pm PDT

Hey I just realized that I'm missing a black down style jacket. I normally have it in my bag and just assumed I took it out but upon trying to find it this morning I must have lost it. Long shot but if you find a black down jacket that's blue on the inside it might be mine. Perhaps I lost it at a party or something

1751624542@facebook.comFriday, September 9, 2016 at 12:25pm PDT
seems more like we will go get the food ourselves instead of actually getting served though

100002430109330@facebook.comFriday, September 9, 2016 at 12:25pm PDT
Ticket might give you a chair as well? Anyway you should come, the afterparty is going to be awesome!

807722489@facebook.comFriday, September 9, 2016 at 12:25pm PDT
Yes, although I spoke to staben, and depending on how they serve the food, the sex people might want us a bit separate so they can easily tell who to serve food and not. After the food is served we should be good to mix with the others though :)

1751624542@facebook.comFriday, September 9, 2016 at 12:24pm PDT
you should! you can still sit with us and everything

100000136758517@facebook.comFriday, September 9, 2016 at 12:22pm PDT
No ticket = bring your own food

Since it is hard to get cheap beer in Sweden we prepared by going to Germany and buy a lot, you can buy beer for yourself but you don't have to bring beer for the entire group. Also be nice and pay henrik for the beers you take <3

Accept correntin in the group hes late and couldnt come before

807722489@facebook.comMonday, August 29, 2016 at 5:13pm PDT
No, it's just mandatory that you attend and pass one of them

100000358561047@facebook.comMonday, August 29, 2016 at 5:13pm PDT
So, the laboratory session is not mandatory in that case

807722489@facebook.comMonday, August 29, 2016 at 5:12pm PDT
So go to another lab time instead

1120252296@facebook.comMonday, August 29, 2016 at 5:12pm PDT
And you can probably lab another day

1120252296@facebook.comMonday, August 29, 2016 at 5:11pm PDT
One of them is a lab

Hey guys, if your LU cards aren't working, (like me, gemma and victoria), you can go to the VAKTMASTERI in the basement of the E building.
